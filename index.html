		<p>I am a Lecturer IV in the School of Information at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. I focus on the introductory programming courses such as Data-Oriented Programming (SI 206) and the Web Design Courses (SI 339 and SI 539).</p>

		<p>My previous jobs include Associate Professor at California State University and positions at NASA JPL, the Naval Research Lab, and the NSA. I received my BS from <a href="https://www.kent.edu/">Kent State University Honors College</a> in Computer Science, and an MS and PhD from the University of Pittsburgh, also in Computer Science. My thesis was on Artificial Intelligence applications on the Nursebot Project, a robotic assistant for the elderly.</p>

		<p>My honors include being chosen as a National Physical Sciences Consortium Fellow and a NASA Faculty Fellow. I have always emphasized the idea of technology for everybody. To that I have worked to create courses for education majors to learn robotics, as well other CS curriculum for non-majors. Her current focus is outreach with elementary and middle school students to learn problem-solving, coding, and design. I have published three recent books for children, "Web Design with HTML" and more "Web Design with HTML" and "Making a Web Page" (co-authored with my son).</p>
